# Voting-based Methods for Evaluating Source and Facts Reliability

## Requirements

pip3 install scipy

## example run command

With Python3

in root project :

run main with plurality : `python3 -m v4.main.main_plurality`

## examples

Graphs written in a specific format to test the methods.

## generation

Generation of the random graphs to test our methods and the methods from the literature.

## graph

Class to create a graph and run our algorithm on this graph.

## main

Main programm.

## other_methods

Methods from the literature.

## png

Directory to store all the graphics.

## priors

CVS with vectors to help (we just read this file instead of generating all the vectors all the time) the generation.

## results

Results store in .tex file and .log when using the brute force method to generate the graphs.

## test_datasets

Tests on the real datasets

## vote

Class to use the voting methods and generate score from the scoring rule.
